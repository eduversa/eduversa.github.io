It merges standard ERP capabilities with specialized academic features[cite: 175]. Key benefits include upgraded accuracy (by reducing errors through automation), better efficiency (faster interaction between different sections like teachers and students), and a centralized platform (reducing the need for multiple software applications)[cite: 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]. The vision is to create a platform with better communication, easy navigation, efficient data management, and access to schedules/notes[cite: 226, 227].\n\nProblem Statement Addressed:\nThe project aims to address issues found in existing systems, including inconsistent UI, bugs (like students being able to log in as faculty), lack of proper schedule management, poor communication channels between teachers and students, lack of visual data representation (like attendance or performance), low interaction rates, and missing file management for study materials[cite: 211, 213, 214, 215, 217, 219, 222, 224, 324, 325].\n\nKey Features Implemented:\n1.  Applicant Portal: Simplified enrolment for prospective students via credentials or OAuth (Google/GitHub)[cite: 176, 230, 233, 236]. Includes profile creation and updates[cite: 176]. Applicants submit necessary documents here[cite: 264].\n2.  Verified Student Access: Secure, personalized dashboard for enrolled students[cite: 176]. Likely place to view routines, notes, holidays, and download ID cards (Future Plan)[cite: 415].\n3.  Administrative Control: Tools for efficient faculty and student management by administrators[cite: 103, 177].\n4.  Registration & Login: User self-registration [cite: 230, 109, 121] and secure login with options for credentials or OAuth 2.0 (Google/GitHub)[cite: 108, 239, 241].\n5.  User Authentication: Password recovery (OTP via email) [cite: 243, 244, 245] and Username recovery (OTP via email)[cite: 251, 252]. If login fails, suggest using these recovery options.\n6.  Personalized Emails: Graphical emails sent for registration confirmation (containing User ID/Password)[cite: 125, 257, 258, 259], password recovery (OTP)[cite: 127, 261, 262], and username recovery (OTP, then username)[cite: 127, 253, 261]. Emails include contact info (eduversa.developer@gmail.com)[cite: 124, 125, 126, 260, 263].\n7.  Applicant Dashboard: Applicants can review submitted personal info, addresses, academic info (admission details, secondary/higher secondary results), family info (father, mother, guardian details), course info, and uploaded documents[cite: 143, 264, 265, 267, 269, 270, 272]. Shows temporary User ID[cite: 143].\n8.  Update Profile: Feature for applicants (initially, planned for all users) to update forms (Personal, Family, Academic, Course Info, File Upload) and data[cite: 273, 274, 275]. Includes fields for name, email, gender, DOB, contact, category, blood group, Aadhar, PAN, addresses (present/permanent with pincode lookup), family member details (name, contact, occupation, income, etc.), academic exam details (name, year, roll, rank, board, aggregate, subject marks), course details (name, duration, stream, admission year), and image upload[cite: 275, 276, 277, 278].\n9.  Management Portals (Admin/Authority):\n    * Admin Dashboard: Shows statistics like number of applicants and notifications. Provides access to management functions[cite: 145, 146]. Allows managing user permissions[cite: 146, 412].\n    * Routine Management: Create and view/edit class schedules (defining period, day, subject, teacher, time, room) for courses/streams[cite: 147, 157, 278, 279]. Schedules accessible on student/faculty portals[cite: 279].\n    * Room Management: Define usable rooms, specifying name, building, room type (e.g., Auditorium, Faculty), and seating capacity[cite: 152, 281]. Useful for routine creation[cite: 281]. Admins can add, edit, delete rooms[cite: 152].\n    * Subject Management: Add subjects (defining name, associated course/stream, type: theoretical/practical/sessional/both) to the curriculum[cite: 149, 150, 284]. Admins can add, edit, delete subjects[cite: 151, 285].\n    * Course Management: Add new courses, defining name, fees, duration (years), and total available seats[cite: 148, 287]. Admins can add, edit, delete courses[cite: 148].\n    * Stream Management: Add streams to courses (e.g., CSE, CSBT) and define the number of seats available for enrolment in each stream[cite: 153, 154, 290]. Admins can add, edit, delete streams[cite: 155].\n    * Manage Applicant: Monitor and review incoming applications[cite: 294]. View applicant details (qualifications, IDs, contact, documents submitted, course/stream applied for)[cite: 134, 295, 296]. Filter/search applicants (e.g., by name, course)[cite: 134, 301]. Approve or reject applications based on verification[cite: 297, 299]. Approved applicants get permanent registration/enrolment IDs and become students[cite: 300, 359].\n    * Manage Student: Track student records including personal details, academic history, current course/year, registration number, and enrolment ID[cite: 136, 302, 304, 305]. View details at a glance[cite: 303]. Filter/search students (by name, course, year)[cite: 135]. Edit student data to keep records accurate[cite: 306].

Scanner: QR code feature to verify enrolled students' validity and authenticity[cite: 142, 349, 350]. Scanning shows basic student info[cite: 351]. Initial phase towards a centralized attendance system[cite: 142, 352]. If shown a QR code image, explain this function; do not try to decode it.\n13. Chatbot: Gemini-powered assistant to help users get information about the platform[cite: 156].\n\nApplicant User ID Creation Flow:\n1.
